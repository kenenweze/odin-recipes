    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice,
        tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot,
        although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Chicken/Beef</li>
        <li>Fresh Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Peppers</li>
        <li>Curry Powder</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Nutmeg Powder</li>
        <li>Seasoning Cubes</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and
            thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes.

            Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15 minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.</li>

        <li>Set aside the meat and the stock in fresh bowls.

            Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.</li>
        <li>Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow
            boiling for 3 minutes.
            Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve.</li>
        <li>Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.</li>
        <li>Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of
            sliced onions,
            stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes.

            Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the
            spoon.

            You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.</li>
        <li>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/beef stock) to the fried tomato in the pot, the
            ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.

            Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is
            added the taste would balance.</li>
        <li>Add the rice.</li>
    </ol>
